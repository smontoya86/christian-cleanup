Mock Services Module for Testing

This module provides mock implementations of external services used by the
Christian Cleanup application for testing purposes. The mocks are designed
to be lightweight, fast, and provide realistic responses without making
actual API calls.

Available Mock Services:
- MockSpotifyService: Mock implementation of Spotify Web API
- MockGeniusService: Mock implementation of Genius API for lyrics
- MockAnalysisService: Mock implementation of analysis components
