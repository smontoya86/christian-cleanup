# Contributing

- Use short-lived feature branches and open Draft PRs early.
- Run locally before pushing:
  - pre-commit run -a
  - pytest -q
- Follow Conventional Commits in PR titles (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:).
- Update docs when behavior changes (README and docs/).
- All changes go via PR; main is protected.
