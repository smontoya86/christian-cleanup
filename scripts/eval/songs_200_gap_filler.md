## Strategy Notes

**Why These Songs Will Hit Target Ranges:**

**50-54**: Pure secular positivity without ANY spiritual language to avoid the 45 vague spirituality cap. These songs reflect common grace and moral values without God-language.

**55-59**: Songs with mild hope/inspirational themes that hint at faith but don't explicitly name God. These sit between the 45 cap and the 60+ common grace zone.

**60-64**: Common grace examples with strong moral frameworks - justice, compassion, family values. Clear alignment with biblical principles without explicit worship.

**70-74**: Christian worship songs with minor theological issues (Hillsong's prosperity hints, vague language) OR extremely strong secular moral songs. This is the "good but not great" zone.

**80-84**: Solid worship songs that aren't doctrinally perfect - older praise songs, crossover worship, songs with minor charismatic elements or repetition issues.
