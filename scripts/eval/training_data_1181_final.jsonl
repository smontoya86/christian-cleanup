the whole world on my shoulders\n I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\n Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\n I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\n I'm supposed to set an example\n I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\n If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\n That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\n There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\n I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost

more is it?\n It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'\n We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\n Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\n And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him\n Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\n Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\n Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions\n Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\n Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\n Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\n But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\n Was through that publication the same one that made me famous\n Now the owner of it has got a grudge

roof\n We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included\n A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse\n We were so bulletproof\u2014wrote, souped and soaked in our youth\n Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe\n The death of Doody broke us in two\n We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do\n And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too\n So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through\n Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew\n I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew\n The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew\n How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds\n I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth\n 'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group\n Shoot...\n If I could leave this all behind\n I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\n Down to the river with you\n Help me leave this all behind\n I'ma wash away my sins\n I'ma rinse away this dirt\n I forgot to make amends\n To all the friends I may have hurt\n I better stop and say my grace\n From it I pray that I don't fall\n 'Cause on the way back down I may\n End up runnin' back into them all\n I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n It was never the same, and it's bothered me since\n And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets\n The more time goes by, the more life happens\n And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities\n Plus we don't say how we feel\n And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in\n Been with you guys thick and thin\n But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends\n Which reminded me Biz, \"Rockstar\" was the shit\n Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit\n If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did\n More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it\n I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is\n I think of all of the trips to BET\n And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with\n Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features\n But that's water under the bridge\n But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed\n If I could leave this all behind\n I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\n Down to the river with you\n Help me leave this all behind\n I'ma wash away my sins\n I'ma rinse away this dirt\n I forgot to make amends\n To all the friends I may have hurt\n I better stop and say my grace\n From it I pray that I don't fall\n 'Cause on the way back down I may\n End up runnin' back into them all\n I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end\n One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits\n You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift\n To these kids you no longer exist\n Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch\n To tiny drops, little drips\n And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed\n You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed\n All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get\n For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?\n A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished\n I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment\n But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none\n I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this\n To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am\n This is not how I planned for our story to end\n I love all of you men\n But I just can't be the guy everybody depends\n On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair\n I will always be here, but that spark isn't there\n And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era\n I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air\n I'm barely chartin' myself\n Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent\n To treat y'all like a stepping stone\n Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road\n Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up\n But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live\n The less is left for closure, so let's let this go\n It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over\n I'ma wash away my sins\n I'ma rinse away this dirt\n I forgot to make amends\n To all the friends I may have hurt\n I better stop and say my grace\n From it I pray that I don't fall\n 'Cause on the way back down I may\n End up runnin' back into them all\n I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n I never mant to make you feel
