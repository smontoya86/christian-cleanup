## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Known Limitations & Resolutions

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: Rate Limiting**
- **Original Issue:** Only 186/272 songs labeled due to high concurrency (10)
- **Resolution:** Reduced concurrency to 3, successfully labeled all 86 missing songs
- **Final Result:** 100% completion (272/272 songs) ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ **Vague Spirituality Cap: 89.7% Enforcement**
- **Target:** >85% enforcement
- **Actual:** 89.7% (70/78 vague spiritual songs ‚â§45)
- **Songs exceeding 45:** 8/78 (examples: "The Prayer" scored 65, others 50-65)
- **Impact:** Acceptable - exceptions are still flagged as "context_required" or "caution_limit," not "freely_listen"
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PASS (meets >85% target)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Edge Case: "The Prayer" Exception**
- Consistently scores 60-65 despite vague spirituality
- Still correctly flagged as "context_required"
- **Decision:** Acceptable for baseline - cap working for 89.7% of cases
