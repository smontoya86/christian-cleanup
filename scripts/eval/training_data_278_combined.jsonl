soldier\n Stiffen up that upper lip\n What you crying about?\n You got me\n Hailie, I know you miss your mom\n And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone\n But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had\n I can see you're sad\n Even when you smile\n Even when you laugh\n I can see it in your eyes\n Deep inside, you wanna cry\n Cuz you're scared\n I ain't there?\n Daddy's with you in your prayers\n No more crying\n Wipe them tears\n Daddy's here\n No more nightmares\n We gonna pull together through it\n We gon' do it\n Laney, uncle's crazy ain't he?\n Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it\n We're all we got in this world\n When it spins\n When it swirls\n When it whirls\n When it twirls\n Two little beautiful girls\n Looking puzzled, in a daze\n I know it's confusing you\n Daddy's always on the move\n Mama's always on the news\n I try to keep you sheltered from it\n But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that\n The more it backfires on me\n All the things, growing up\n As daddy that he had to see\n Daddy don't want you to see\n But you see just as much as he did\n That we did not plan it to be this way\n You're mother and me\n But things have got so bad between us\n I don't see us ever being\n Together ever again\n Like we used to be when was teenagers\n But then of course\n Everything always happens for a reason\n I guess it was never meant to be\n But it's just something\n We have no control over\n And that's what destiny is\n But no more worries\n Rest your head and go to sleep\n Maybe one day we'll wake up\n And this will all just be a dream\n Now hush little baby don't you cry\n Everythings gonna be alright\n Stiffen that upper lip up little lady\n I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya\n Through the night\n I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\n We feel how we feel inside\n It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\n But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright\n It's funny\n I remember back one year when daddy had no money\n Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up\n And stuck them under the tree\n And said some of them were from me\n Cos daddy couldn't buy 'em\n I'll never forget that Christmas\n I sat up the whole night cryin'\n Cuz daddy felt like a bum\n See daddy had a job\n But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\n And at the time every house that we lived in\n Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\n And your mom, was saving money\n For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you\n So you can go to college\n Almost had a thousand dollars\n Till someone broke in and stole it\n And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mama's heart\n And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart\n Mom and dads was arguing a lot\n So mama moved back on the Chalmers (?) in the flat\n One bedroom apartment\n And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra\n And that's when daddy went to California with his CD\n And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me\n But daddy had to work\n You and mama had to leave me\n Then you started seeing daddy on the TV\n And mama didn't like it\n And you and Laney were too young to understand it\n Papa was a rolling stone\n Mama developed a habit\n And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\n I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\n Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'\n Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out\n To see how much you both have grown\n It's almost like your sisters now\n Wow, I guess you pretty much are\n And daddy's still here\n Laney I'm talking to you too\n Daddy's still here\n I like the sound of that, yeah\n It's got a ring to it, don't it?\n Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment\n Now hush little baby don't you cry\n Everythings gonna be alright\n Stiffen that upper lip up little lady\n I told ya daddy's here to hold ya\n Through the night\n I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\n We feel how we feel inside\n It may seem a little crazy pretty baby\n But I promise\n Mama's gonna be alright\n And if you ask me to\n Daddy's gonna buy you a mocking bird\n I'ma give you the world\n I'ma buy a diamond ring for you\n I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile\n And if the mockingbird don't sing and the ring don't shine\n I'ma break that birdy's neck\n I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya\n And make him eat every karat\n Don't fuck wit dat\n Haha", "label":

like toy soldiers\n Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win\n But the battle wages on for toy soldiers\n I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure\n Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\n I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\n Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\n I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\n I'm supposed to set an example\n I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\n If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\n That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\n There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\n I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost

caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\n This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\n That was never my object for someone to get killed\n Why would I wanna destroy something I help build\n It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\n I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'\n And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth\n And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about\n Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\n So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\n While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life\n Like fuck it i understand this is business\n And this shit just isn't none of my business\n But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause\n

could just say a rhyme\n And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'\n But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it\n The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?\n It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'\n We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\n Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\n And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him\n Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\n Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\n Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions\n Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\n Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\n Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\n But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\n Was through that publication the same one that made me famous\n Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'\n Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then\n But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\n That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\n And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\n We still have soldiers that's on the front line\n That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\n Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us\n We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is\n To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners\n Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\n But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\n It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\n Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict\n I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\n But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\n I'm just willin' to be the bigger man\n If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can\n Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\n I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause\n Step by step,
