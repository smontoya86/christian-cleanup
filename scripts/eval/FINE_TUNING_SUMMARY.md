## Training Data Format

Each training example includes:

### 1. **System Message** (FULL Framework - ~2,400 tokens)
```
You are a theological music analyst using the Christian Framework v3.1.
Return ONLY valid JSON (no prose) with this schema:
...
[Complete framework with:
- 6 Critical Rules (mandatory scripture, sentiment analysis, etc.)
- 35+ Positive Themes with point values
- 28+ Negative Themes with penalties
- Verdict Guidelines (freely_listen, context_required, caution_limit, avoid_formation)
- Formation Risk levels
- Narrative Voice categories
- Lament Filter logic]
```

### 2. **User Message** (~2,500 tokens avg)
```
Analyze the following song:

Title: [Song Title]
Artist: [Artist Name]

Lyrics:
[Full lyrics, ~2,000 chars avg]

Provide theological analysis using the Christian Framework v3.1...
```

### 3. **Assistant Message** (JSON response, ~200 tokens)
```json
{
  "score": 85,
  "verdict": "freely_listen",
  "formation_risk": "low",
  "narrative_voice": "artist",
  "lament_filter_applied": false,
  "themes_positive": ["Worship & Adoration (+10)", ...],
  "themes_negative": [],
  "concerns": [],
  "scripture_references": ["Psalm 103:1", "Hebrews 13:15"],
  "analysis": "Brief explanation..."
}
```

## Token Usage & Costs

### Training Data Size:
- **Per Example**: ~5,100 tokens (2,400 system + 2,500 user + 200 assistant)
- **Total Training Tokens**: ~5,594,700 tokens (1,097 examples × 5,100)
- **Total Validation Tokens**: ~698,700 tokens (137 examples × 5,100)

### Fine-Tuning Costs (OpenAI Pricing):
- **Training Cost**: $44.76 (5,594,700 tokens × $0.008/1K)
- **Validation Cost**: $5.59 (698,700 tokens × $0.008/1K)
- **Total Fine-Tuning Cost**: ~$50.35

### Inference Costs (Post Fine-Tuning):
**Current (GPT-4o-mini base)**:
- Input: $0.150/1M tokens
- Output: $0.600/1M tokens
- Per song: ~$0.0013 (2,500 input + 200 output)

**After Fine-Tuning (GPT-4o-mini fine-tuned)**:
- Input: $0.300/1M tokens (2× base)
- Output: $1.200/1M tokens (2× base)
- Per song: ~$0.0010 (50 input + 200 output) *with simplified prompt*
- **OR** ~$0.0016 (2,400 input + 200 output) *with full prompt*

**Cost Analysis**:
- Using simplified prompt at inference: **23% cheaper** than current
- Using full prompt at inference: **23% more expensive** but **maximum consistency**

## Why Full System Prompt in Training?

### Benefits:

**1. Complete Framework Internalization**
- Model learns ALL 35+ positive themes and their point values
- Model learns ALL 28+ negative themes and their penalties
- Model learns Common Grace rules (60-75 scoring for secular moral songs)
- Model learns Vague Spirituality Cap (MAX 45 for unclear theology)
- Model learns Character Voice penalty reduction (30% off for storytelling)
- Model learns Lament Filter logic (biblical grief vs glorifying sin)

**2. Maximum Consistency**
- Same prompt in training AND inference = identical behavior
- Reduces hallucinations and scoring drift
- More reliable JSON structure
- Better adherence to mandatory scripture requirements

**3. Edge Case Handling**
- 1,372 examples teach it real-world edge cases
- Learns nuances like "Lean on Me" (secular but positive) vs "Imagine" (anti-Christian)
- Learns character voice (Eminem's storytelling) vs artist endorsement
- Learns lament (biblical grief) vs complaint (unbiblical negativity)

**4. Inference Flexibility**
You can still:
- Use the full prompt for maximum accuracy
- Use a simplified prompt if model performs well without it
- Add specific instructions: "Be extra cautious about profanity"
- Adjust for different use cases post-training

### Trade-offs:

**Higher Training Cost**: $50 vs ~$20 (minimal prompt)
- **But**: One-time cost

**Higher Inference Cost** (if using full prompt): ~$0.0016/song vs ~$0.0010/song
- **But**: Still 2-10× cheaper than GPT-4
- **But**: Can test simplified prompt post-training

**Larger Files**: ~5MB per file vs ~2MB (minimal prompt)
- **But**: Negligible storage/bandwidth cost

## Expected Results

### Improvements Over Base GPT-4o-mini:

**1. Scoring Consistency** (+30-40%)
- Base model: Varies 10-15 points for similar songs
- Fine-tuned: Varies 3-5 points for similar songs

**2. Scripture Accuracy** (+50%)
- Base model: 60-70% include relevant scripture
- Fine-tuned: 95-100% include relevant scripture (trained on 100% coverage)

**3. JSON Format Reliability** (+90%)
- Base model: ~10% invalid JSON or missing fields
- Fine-tuned: ~1% format errors

**4. Edge Case Handling** (+60%)
- Base model: Struggles with common grace, vague spirituality, character voice
- Fine-tuned: 1,372 examples teach these nuances

**5. Theological Accuracy** (+40%)
- Base model: Sometimes confuses secular morality with biblical alignment
- Fine-tuned: Learns 60-75 range for common grace, MAX 45 for vague spirituality
