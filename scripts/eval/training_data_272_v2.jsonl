the whole world on my shoulders\n I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\n Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\n I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\n I'm supposed to set an example\n I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\n If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\n That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\n There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\n I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost

something I help build\n It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\n I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'\n And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth\n And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about\n Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\n So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\n While he's all over t.v. down

more is it?\n It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'\n We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\n Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\n And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him\n Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\n Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\n Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions\n Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\n Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\n Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\n But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\n Was through that publication the same one that made me famous\n Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'\n Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then\n But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\n That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\n And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\n We still have soldiers that's on the front line\n That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\n Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us\n We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is\n To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners\n Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\n But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\n It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\n Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict\n I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\n But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\n I'm just willin' to be the bigger man\n If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can\n Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\n I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause\n Step by step,
