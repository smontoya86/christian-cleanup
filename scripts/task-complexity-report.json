      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Environment",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Structure and Environment' task into 4 subtasks, focusing on: 1) Creating the Flask project structure with all required directories and files, 2) Setting up Docker and Docker Compose configuration, 3) Configuring environment variables and configuration files, and 4) Initializing the Flask application with basic routes and database connection.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up multiple components (Flask structure, Docker, environment configs) and requires careful coordination between them. While each component is relatively straightforward, ensuring they work together properly adds complexity. The detailed file structure and configuration requirements indicate moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Database Models and Migrations",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Database Models and Migrations' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Define SQLAlchemy models for User, Playlist, Song, and AnalysisResult with proper relationships, 2) Set up Flask-Migrate for database migrations, and 3) Create and run initial migration scripts to establish the database schema.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires defining multiple database models with relationships between them. The complexity is moderate as the models are well-defined in the requirements, but proper implementation of relationships and constraints requires careful attention. Setting up migrations adds another layer of complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Spotify OAuth Authentication",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Spotify OAuth Authentication' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Create the authentication blueprint with login and callback routes, 2) Implement token storage and refresh mechanism, 3) Create user session management functionality, and 4) Implement the token_required decorator for protecting routes.",
      "reasoning": "OAuth implementation is inherently complex, involving multiple API calls, token management, and security considerations. The task requires handling authentication flow, token refresh, session management, and database operations. Error handling for various authentication scenarios adds further complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Playlist Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Playlist Dashboard' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Create the main blueprint with dashboard route that fetches and processes playlist data from Spotify, 2) Develop the dashboard template with responsive UI components for displaying playlists and their scores, and 3) Implement the base template and CSS styling for consistent application design.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines backend API integration with frontend development. It requires fetching data from Spotify, processing it, storing in the database, and presenting it in a user-friendly interface. The UI components include dynamic elements like progress bars and responsive cards."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Playlist Detail View",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Playlist Detail View' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Create the playlist detail route that fetches and processes track data from Spotify, 2) Develop the playlist detail template with track listing and analysis results, 3) Implement the modal dialogs for detailed track analysis information, and 4) Create the UI components for track management actions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex data processing and UI development. It requires fetching detailed track information, handling various states (analyzed, whitelisted, etc.), and creating interactive UI elements like modals and action buttons. The complex table layout and conditional rendering add to the complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Lyrics Fetching Service",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Lyrics Fetching Service' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Create the LyricsFetcher class with methods to fetch lyrics from Genius API, 2) Implement fallback mechanisms for alternative lyrics sources, and 3) Develop lyrics cleaning and processing functionality to prepare text for analysis.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with error handling and fallback mechanisms. The complexity comes from dealing with potentially unreliable external services, implementing proper error handling, and cleaning/processing text data. The fallback mechanism adds another layer of complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement AI-Powered Song Analysis Engine",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement AI-Powered Song Analysis Engine' task into 5 subtasks: 1) Set up the SongAnalyzer class with model initialization and configuration, 2) Implement lyrics analysis functionality using the AI model, 3) Create theme extraction and problematic content identification methods, 4) Develop Bible verse lookup functionality, and 5) Implement the complete song analysis workflow with score calculation.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task in the project, involving AI model integration, natural language processing, and multiple external API calls. It requires handling large text inputs, processing them through AI models, extracting semantic information, and generating meaningful scores and recommendations. The Bible verse lookup adds another layer of complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Song Management Actions",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Song Management Actions' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Create routes for whitelisting songs and playlists, 2) Implement functionality to remove songs from playlists via the Spotify API, and 3) Update the UI templates to include whitelist status and management actions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing several related features for managing songs and playlists. The complexity is moderate as it requires integration with Spotify's API for playlist modifications and implementing database operations for whitelisting. The UI updates are relatively straightforward."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Threshold Display and Explanations' task into 2 subtasks: 1) Create the explanation page with detailed information about the scoring system and theme categories, and 2) Add score legends and explanatory elements to the dashboard and playlist detail pages.",
      "reasoning": "This task is primarily focused on creating informational content and UI elements. The complexity is relatively low as it mainly involves HTML/CSS work and adding static content. The integration with existing pages adds some complexity but is straightforward."

      "reasoning": "This task involves preparing the application for production deployment, which requires addressing security, performance, and reliability concerns. The complexity comes from configuring multiple components (Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx) to work together in a production environment, setting up proper environment isolation, and ensuring the application can be monitored and maintained."
