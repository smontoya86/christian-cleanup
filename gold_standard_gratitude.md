This is a gold standard analysis for the song 'Gratitude' by Brandon Lake, based on the review from TheBereanTest.com.

**Overall Score:** 7.5/10

**Summary:**
Though Lake cannot find the words or song to satisfactorily thank God, he worships Him because He is eternal and a King. Lake thinks that his only method is to physically worship God, imploring others to sing loudly alongside him. While a noble response, I make a case in section 2 why obedience is our sole reply.

**Biblical Alignment:**
Much of this song aligns with the Bible, except in Chorus and Verse 3, where it states that Lake’s sole response to gratitude is physical signs of worship.

**For Outsiders:**
Unbelievers will likely interpret this song as christians worshipping their God with arms high, shouting, and singing because He exists forever as their ruler. They will probably think it’s Christian because Lake worships his King with the word “hallelujah”. The jury’s out on whether or not they will know that Lake didn’t mention obedience that also glorifies God.

**Glorification:**
While it glorifies God that Lake shows gratitude through physical signs of worship, he is incorrect that worship is our sole reply. Obedience is another method to show gratitude.

**Closing Comments:**
Brandon Lake’s Gratitude is decent. Though I am grateful that Lake wants us to worship God with our hands in the air, alongside loud singing, God’s eternal existence, and God’s Kingship, he is incorrect that such physical worship is our sole response. I’ve argued in section 2 that obedience is also how we show God how much we love Him. Unbelievers will likely conclude similarly, though perhaps not knowing that obeying God also glorifies Him.

I cannot recommend this song for corporate worship.
