# Database Relationship Audit - Final Report

## ✅ Audit Complete - All Issues Resolved

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Scope:** Complete codebase scan for SQLAlchemy relationship mismatches

---

## 🔍 What We Audited

Reviewed all database model relationships against their actual usage in:
- Routes (`app/routes/`)
- Services (`app/services/`)
- Utilities (`app/utils/`)

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Song.playlists (DOESN'T EXIST)
**Location:** `app/routes/main.py` line 33  
**Error:** `AttributeError: type object 'Song' has no attribute 'playlists'`  
**Fix:** Changed to `Song.playlist_associations`

**Why:** Song uses a many-to-many relationship through PlaylistSong junction table, not a direct `playlists` relationship.

---

### Issue #2-5: AnalysisResult.song (DOESN'T EXIST)
**Locations:**
- `app/routes/main.py` line 41
- `app/services/unified_analysis_service.py` line 385 (get_analysis_progress)
- `app/services/unified_analysis_service.py` line 397 (get_analysis_progress)
- `app/services/unified_analysis_service.py` line 442 (get_unanalyzed_songs_count)

**Error:** `AttributeError: type object 'AnalysisResult' has no attribute 'song'`  
**Fix:** Changed all to `AnalysisResult.song_rel`

**Why:** The AnalysisResult model uses `song_rel` as the relationship name to avoid naming conflicts.

## ✅ Verification Results

### No Incorrect References Remaining:
```bash
grep -rn "Song\.playlists" app --include="*.py"
# ✅ No matches found

grep -rn "Playlist\.songs" app --include="*.py"  
# ✅ No matches found

grep -rn "AnalysisResult\.song\b" app --include="*.py"
# ✅ No matches found
```

### All Correct Patterns Verified:
- ✅ `Song.playlist_associations` (23 usages)
- ✅ `AnalysisResult.song_rel` (5 usages)
- ✅ `Playlist.song_associations` (used throughout)
- ✅ `User.playlists` (proper relationship)
- ✅ `Playlist.owner` (proper relationship)

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

All database relationship references are now verified accurate and match the model definitions in `app/models/models.py`.

**Next Step:** User can now test the full application flow including:
1. Spotify login/callback
2. Dashboard loading
3. Playlist sync
4. Song analysis
5. Progress tracking
