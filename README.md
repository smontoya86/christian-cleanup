## üê≥ **DOCKER-FIRST PROJECT**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is a Docker-first application. All commands should be run through Docker containers, not locally.**

- **Web App**: `docker compose exec web <command>`
- **Database**: `docker compose exec db <command>`
- Workers have been removed; analysis runs in the web service.
- **Redis**: `docker compose exec redis redis-cli`
