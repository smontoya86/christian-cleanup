# Christian Music Alignment App

## Overview

This application analyzes Spotify playlists to determine their alignment with Christian values. It fetches song lyrics, uses AI to identify themes and potentially problematic content, links themes to Bible verses, and provides an overall alignment score.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
3.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` (to be created in a later task) and populate the necessary API keys and configurations.
4.  Build and run the application using Docker Compose: `docker-compose up --build` (Docker setup will be part of a later task).
5.  Access the application at `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured).
