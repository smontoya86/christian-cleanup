## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (9.2/10)
This beloved hymn presents Jesus Christ as the perfect friend who provides comfort, understanding, and intercession for believers. The central message emphasizes the privilege of prayer and the intimate relationship believers can have with Christ, who understands their struggles and carries their burdens.

### Biblical Alignment (9.3/10)
The hymn aligns well with biblical teachings about Christ as friend (John 15:15), intercessor (Hebrews 7:25), and burden-bearer (Matthew 11:28-30). The emphasis on prayer reflects biblical encouragement to cast all anxieties on God (1 Peter 5:7) and the promise that Christ understands our weaknesses (Hebrews 4:15-16).

### Outsider Interpretation (8.5/10)
While the hymn clearly presents Christian themes, the concept of Jesus as "friend" might be interpreted in overly casual terms by some. However, the overall context of prayer, sin, and spiritual comfort maintains a distinctly Christian framework that would be difficult to misinterpret completely.

### Glorification of God (9.0/10)
The hymn focuses on Christ's character as compassionate friend and faithful intercessor. While it emphasizes the comfort believers receive, it consistently points to Christ's unique role and character as the source of that comfort, maintaining a Christ-centered perspective throughout.

## Theological Strengths
The hymn beautifully balances Christ's divine nature with His approachable character as friend. It encourages prayer and dependence on Christ while maintaining appropriate reverence. The emphasis on Christ's understanding of human weakness and His role as intercessor reflects solid biblical theology.

## Test Criteria
This hymn should score highly due to its biblical foundation, Christ-centered focus, and practical application of Christian doctrine. While the "friend" language might be slightly less formal than some hymns, the overall theological content is excellent and the practical emphasis on prayer is valuable.

**Expected Score:** 9.1/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Green - Highly recommended for all listeners
