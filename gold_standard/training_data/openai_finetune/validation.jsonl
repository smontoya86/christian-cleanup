**MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

Spirituality Cap**:\n   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score\n   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content\n   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     * Reduce content penalties by 30% (sexual immorality, violence, etc.)\n     * Maintain formation risk assessment (still flag as high risk)\n     * Add note: \"This song portrays [behavior] as

  - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

**MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain about theological alignment, score lower and flag concerns\n\n4. **Common Grace Recognition (Rom 2:14-15)**:\n   - **Secular songs with biblical values** (kindness, community, integrity, compassion, self-reflection) WITHOUT explicit God-focus should score 60-75 (context_required), NOT below 50\n   - Award +2-4 for Common Grace Righteousness when reflecting God's moral law\n   - Award +2-5 for Gospel Echo if spiritual longing or moral clarity present\n   - Still deduct -10 for Vague Spirituality (acknowledge gap in God-focus)\n   - Deduct -10 for Misplaced Faith if self-salvation/self-reliance emphasized\n   - Examples: \"Lean on Me\" (community), \"Man in the Mirror\" (self-reflection), \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (compassion)\n   \n   **CRITICAL: Vague Spirituality Cap**:\n   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score\n   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content\n   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     * Reduce content penalties by 30% (sexual immorality, violence, etc.)\n     * Maintain formation risk assessment (still flag as high risk)\n     * Add note: \"This song portrays [behavior] as [cautionary tale/character study]\"\n   - DO NOT assume meaning beyond literal words - take lyrics at face value\n   - Character voice ≠ endorsement, but content still influences formation\n   - Examples: Eminem's \"Stan\" (mentally ill fan), narrative ballads, story songs\n\n6. **Technical Rules**:\n   - Concerns categories: [Idolatry, Blasphemy, Sexual Immorality, Profanity, Violence/Revenge, Greed/Materialism, Pride/Arrogance, Deception/Manipulation, Substance Abuse, Occult, Misogyny/Objectification, Theological Error, Trivializing Sin, Humanistic Philosophy, Vague Spirituality]\n   - Severity levels: low, medium, high, critical\n   - Narrative voice: artist | character | collective | God\n   - Lament filter: Apply for songs expressing grief/doubt/struggle

storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**:

prophesize with your pen\n And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again\n And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin\n And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'\n For the loser now will be later to win\n 'Cause the times, they are a-changin'\n\n Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call\n Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall\n For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled\n 'Cause the battle outside ragin'\n Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls\n For the times, they are a-changin'\n\n Come mothers and fathers throughout the land\n And don't criticize what you can't understand\n Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command\n Your old road is rapidly aging\n Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand\n 'Cause the times, they are a-changin'\n\n The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast\n The slowest now will later be fast\n As the present now will later be past\n The order is rapidly fadin'\n And

scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for

storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**:

storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n

cry?\n Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie\n I love the way you lie\n I can't tell you what it really is\n I can only tell you what it feels like\n And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe\n I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight\n As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight\n High off her love, drunk from her hate\n It's like I'm huffin' paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate\n And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me\n She f- hates me, and I love it\n \"Wait! Where you going?\" \"I'm leaving you\"\n \"No, you ain't, come back\"\n We're running right back, here we go again\n It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great\n I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane\n But when it's bad, it's awful\n I feel so ashamed, I snapped, \"Who's that dude?\"\n I don't even know his name\n I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again\n I guess I don't know my own strength\n Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?\n Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts\n Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?\n Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie\n I love the way you lie\n I love the way you lie\n\n You ever loved somebody so much\n You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?\n You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em\n Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em\n Now you're gettin' f- sick of lookin' at 'em?\n You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em\n Now you're in each other's face, spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em\n You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em\n Throw 'em down, pin 'em\n So lost in them moments when you're in 'em\n It's the rage that took over, it controls you both\n So they say you're best to go your separate ways\n Guess that they don't know you 'cause today, that was yesterday\n Yesterday is over, it's a different day\n Sound like broken records playin' over, but you promised her\n Next time, you'll show restraint\n You don't get another chance\n Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again\n Now you get to watch her leave out the window\n Guess that's why they call it windowpane\n Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?\n Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts\n Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?\n Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie\n I love the way you lie\n\n I love the way you lie\n\n Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean\n Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine\n But your temper's just as bad as mine is\n You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded\n Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me\n Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\n Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\n All I know is I love you too much to walk away, though\n Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\n Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?\n Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball\n Next time I'm p-, I'll aim my fist at the drywall\n \"Next time? There won't be no next time\"\n I apologize, even though I know it's lies\n I'm tired of the games, I just want her back\n I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to f- leave again\n I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire\n Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?\n Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts\n Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?\n Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie\n I love the way you lie\n I love the way you lie\n\nProvide a theological analysis using the Christian Framework v3.1.

**MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain about theological alignment, score lower and flag concerns\n\n4. **Common Grace Recognition (Rom 2:14-15)**:\n   - **Secular songs with biblical values** (kindness, community, integrity, compassion, self-reflection) WITHOUT explicit God-focus should score 60-75 (context_required), NOT below 50\n   - Award +2-4 for Common Grace Righteousness when reflecting God's moral law\n   - Award +2-5 for Gospel Echo if spiritual longing or moral clarity present\n   - Still deduct -10 for Vague Spirituality (acknowledge gap in God-focus)\n   - Deduct -10 for Misplaced Faith if self-salvation/self-reliance emphasized\n   - Examples: \"Lean on Me\" (community), \"Man in the Mirror\" (self-reflection), \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (compassion)\n   \n   **CRITICAL: Vague Spirituality Cap**:\n   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score\n   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content\n   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     * Reduce content penalties by 30% (sexual immorality, violence, etc.)\n     * Maintain formation risk assessment (still flag as high risk)\n     * Add note: \"This song portrays [behavior] as

scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

**MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain about theological alignment, score lower and flag concerns\n\n4. **Common Grace Recognition (Rom 2:14-15)**:\n   - **Secular songs with biblical values** (kindness, community, integrity, compassion, self-reflection) WITHOUT explicit God-focus should score 60-75 (context_required), NOT below 50\n   - Award +2-4 for Common Grace Righteousness when reflecting God's moral law\n   - Award +2-5 for Gospel Echo if spiritual longing or moral clarity present\n   - Still deduct -10 for Vague Spirituality (acknowledge gap in God-focus)\n   - Deduct -10 for Misplaced Faith if self-salvation/self-reliance emphasized\n   - Examples: \"Lean on Me\" (community), \"Man in the Mirror\" (self-reflection), \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (compassion)\n   \n   **CRITICAL: Vague Spirituality Cap**:\n   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score\n   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content\n   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     * Reduce content penalties by 30% (sexual immorality, violence, etc.)\n     * Maintain formation risk assessment (still flag as high risk)\n     * Add note: \"This song portrays [behavior] as [cautionary tale/character study]\"\n   - DO NOT assume meaning beyond literal words - take lyrics at face value\n   - Character voice ≠ endorsement, but content still influences formation\n   -

**MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

- Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     *

I'm on a roll this time\n And heaven is in sight\n\n I turn the music up\n I got my records on\n From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song\n Don't want to see another generation drop\n I'd rather be a comma than a full stop\n Maybe I'm in the black\n Maybe I'm on my knees\n Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes\n But my heart is beating and my pulses start\n Cathedrals in my heart\n As we saw, woah, this light\n I swear you, emerge blinking into\n To tell me it's alright\n As we soar walls\n Every siren is a symphony\n And every tear's a waterfall\n Is a waterfall, oh\n Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh\n Is a, is a waterfall\n Every tear\n Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh\n So you can hurt\n Hurt me bad\n But still I'll raise the flag\n Ooh\n\n It was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall\n A

thing that the world has to offer\n Magnify, magnify, lift it on high\n Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on His side\n I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies\n Lullabies and alibis\n The book don't end with Malachi\n Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen\n 'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't\n My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'\n You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins\n Shabach barak, edify\n Electrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrified\n Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide\n 79th, 79th, I don't believe in science\n I believe in signs\n Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs\n Color white collar crime\n Good God, the gift of freedom\n Hosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor\n My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early\n The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early\n With the faith of a

was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine\n But you was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line\n From a lofty height we wage war\n On the poltergeist with

swallow a valley for every African village burned\n Jay Elect would've never made it\n O' son of man, O' son of man\n Who was the angel in Revelations with a foot on water and a foot on land?\n Who

were right for me\n But felt so lonely in your company\n But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember\n\n You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness\n\n Like resignation to the end, always the end\n So when we found that we could not make sense\n Well, you said that we would still be friends\n But I'll admit that I was glad it was over\n\n But you didn't have to cut me off\n Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin'\n And I don't even need your love\n But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough\n No, you didn't have to stoop so low\n Have your friends collect your records and then change your number\n I guess that I don't need that, though\n Now you're just somebody that I used to know\n\n Now you're just somebody that I used to know\n\n Now you're just somebody that I used to know\n\n Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over\n But had me believin' it was always somethin' that I'd done\n\n And I don't wanna live that way, readin' into every word you say\n You said that you could let it go\n And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know\n But you didn't have to cut me off\n Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin'\n And I don't even need your love\n But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough\n No, you didn't have to stoop so low\n Have your friends collect your records and then change your number\n I guess that I don't need that, though\n Now you're just somebody that I used to know\n Somebody (I used to know)\n Somebody (now you're just somebody that I

scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n

scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

Spirituality Cap**:\n   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score\n   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content\n   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     *

scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for

storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**:

**MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**:

storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**:

**MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

- Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible

\"concerns\": [\"Category (severity)\", ...],\n  \"scripture_references\": [\"Book Chapter:Verse\", ...],\n  \"analysis\": \"Brief explanation of score and verdict\"\n}\n\n## CRITICAL RULES:\n\n1. **MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):\n   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., \"Psalm 103:1\" for worship)\n   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., \"Eph 5:3\" for sexual sin, \"1 John 2:15-17\" for idolatry)\n   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., \"Prov 4:23\" for guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain about theological alignment, score lower and flag concerns\n\n4. **Common Grace Recognition (Rom 2:14-15)**:\n   - **Secular songs with biblical values** (kindness, community, integrity, compassion, self-reflection) WITHOUT explicit God-focus should score 60-75 (context_required), NOT below 50\n   - Award +2-4 for Common Grace Righteousness when reflecting God's moral law\n   - Award +2-5 for Gospel Echo if spiritual longing or moral clarity present\n   - Still deduct -10 for Vague Spirituality (acknowledge gap in God-focus)\n   - Deduct -10 for Misplaced Faith if self-salvation/self-reliance emphasized\n   - Examples: \"Lean on Me\" (community), \"Man in the Mirror\" (self-reflection), \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (compassion)\n   \n   **CRITICAL: Vague Spirituality Cap**:\n   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score\n   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content\n   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     * Reduce content penalties by 30% (sexual immorality, violence, etc.)\n     * Maintain formation risk assessment (still flag as high risk)\n     * Add note: \"This song portrays [behavior] as [cautionary tale/character study]\"\n   - DO NOT assume meaning beyond literal words - take lyrics at face value\n   - Character voice ≠ endorsement, but content still influences formation\n   - Examples: Eminem's \"Stan\" (mentally ill fan), narrative ballads, story songs\n\n6. **Technical Rules**:\n   - Concerns categories: [Idolatry, Blasphemy, Sexual Immorality, Profanity, Violence/Revenge, Greed/Materialism, Pride/Arrogance, Deception/Manipulation, Substance Abuse, Occult, Misogyny/Objectification, Theological Error, Trivializing Sin, Humanistic Philosophy, Vague Spirituality]\n   - Severity levels: low, medium, high, critical\n   - Narrative voice: artist | character | collective | God\n   - Lament filter: Apply for songs expressing grief/doubt/struggle

the curtains and heart like the Fourth of July\n You swore and said we are not\n We are not shining stars\n This I know, I never said we are\n Though I've never been through Hell like that\n I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back\n If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone\n Carry on\n May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground\n Carry on\n Carry on, carry on\n\n So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night\n At a bar off 75\n And we talked and talked about how our parents will die\n All our neighbors and wives\n But I'd like to think I can cheat it all\n To make up for the times I've been cheated on\n And it's nice to know when I was left for dead\n I was found and now I don't roam these streets\n I am not the ghost you are to me\n If you're lost and alone or you're sinkin' like a stone\n Carry on\n May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground, and\n Carry on\n Whoa, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine\n After all, they are mine\n Lay your clothes down on the floor\n Close the door, hold the phones, show me how\n No one's ever gonna stop us now\n\n 'Cause we are, we are shining stars\n We are invincible, we are who we are\n On our darkest day when we're miles away\n So we'll come, we will find our way home\n If you're lost and alone or you're sinkin' like a stone\n Carry on\n May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground, and\n Carry on\n Oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-oh-whoa\n Oh, oh, oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh\n Oh-whoa, oh-oh-oh-whoa\n Oh, oh, oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh\n No one's ever gonna

  - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

guarding hearts)\n\n2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:\n   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview\n   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling\n   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?\n   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin\n\n3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:\n   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)\n   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)\n   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)\n   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)\n   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain

Spirituality Cap**:\n   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score\n   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content\n   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45\n   - Examples: \"Spirit in the Sky\" (vague salvation), \"Let It Be\" (possible Marian devotion), \"Hallelujah\" (sexualizes sacred language)\n   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., \"Imagine\" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)\n   \n5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:\n   - When narrative_voice = \"character\" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):\n     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)\n     * Reduce content penalties by 30% (sexual immorality, violence, etc.)\n     * Maintain formation risk assessment (still flag as high risk)\n     * Add note: \"This song portrays [behavior] as
