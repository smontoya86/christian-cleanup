None,Till I Collapse,Eminem,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak  And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up  But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength  And just pull that shit out of you  And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter  No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse  'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em  'Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em  'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em  And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem  Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?  Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom  Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop  Amoxicillin's just not real enough  The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain  A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners  You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it  Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us  You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock  Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?  For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up  You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out  'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth  'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out  'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth  'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get  When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit  This is your moment, and every single minute you spend  Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again  So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can  And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end  'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in  I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in  It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie  Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me  But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy  So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me  That's why you see me walk 'round like nothing's bothering me  Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me  You hate it but you know respect you got to give me  The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out  'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth  'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out  'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth  'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart  What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart  And it's absurd, how people hang on every word  I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve  But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved  If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first  'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse  That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse  My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict  I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers  But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles  The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers  So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em  The track is on some battling raps who want some static?  'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters  A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out  'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth  'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out  'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth  'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  Until the roof (until the roof)  The roof comes off (the roof comes off)  Until my legs (until my legs)  Give out from underneath me  I, I will not fall, I will stand tall  Feels like no one could beat me",avoid_formation,35,[],[],,[],[],[],[],artist,false,,,null,high,"{""score"": 25, ""verdict"": ""avoid_formation"", ""formation_risk"": ""critical"", ""narrative_voice"": ""artist"", ""lament_filter_applied"": false, ""themes_positive"": [], ""themes_negative"": [""Profanity (-20)"", ""Pride and Self-Focus (-15)"", ""Violence and Aggression (-10)""], ""concerns"": [""Profanity (high)"", ""Pride and Self-Focus (high)"", ""Violence and Aggression (medium)""], ""scripture_references"": [""Ephesians 4:29"", ""Proverbs 16:18"", ""James 4:6""], ""analysis"": ""The song contains explicit language and themes of pride and aggression, which are contrary to biblical teachings; it poses a significant risk to spiritual formation.""}"
None,Where the Streets Have No Name,U2,"I wanna run, I want to hide  I wanna tear down the walls that hold me inside  I wanna reach out and touch the flame  Where the streets have no name (Oh-oh)  I wanna feel sunlight on my face  I see the dust-cloud disappear without a trace  I wanna take shelter from the poison rain, yeah  Where the streets have no name (Oh-oh)  Where the streets have no name  Where the streets have no name  We're still building and burning down love  Burning down love  And when I go there  I go there with you  It's all I can do   The city's a flood and our love turns to rust  We're beaten and blown by the wind  Trampled in dust  I'll show you a place  High on a desert plain  Where the streets have no name (Oh-oh)  Where the streets have no name  Where the streets have no name  We're still building and burning down love  Burning down love  And when I go there  I go there with you  It's all I can do (Oh)  (Oh-oh-oh)  (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah)  (Oh-oh-oh)  (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  Where the streets have no name  Where the streets have no name  We're still building and burning down love  Burning down love  And when I go there  I go there with you  It's all I can do  I wanna go there with you",caution_limit,45,[],[],,[],[],[],[],artist,false,,,null,medium,"{""score"": 45, ""verdict"": ""caution_limit"", ""formation_risk"": ""high"", ""narrative_voice"": ""ambiguous"", ""lament_filter_applied"": false, ""themes_positive"": [""Love (+5)""], ""themes_negative"": [""Vague Spirituality (-15)"", ""Despair and Mental Health (-10)""], ""concerns"": [""Vague Spirituality (medium)"", ""Despair and Mental Health (medium)""], ""scripture_references"": [""1 John 4:8"", ""Proverbs 13:12""], ""analysis"": ""The song expresses a longing for connection and love amidst struggle, but its vague spiritual themes and hints of despair raise concerns about its impact on spiritual formation.""}"
