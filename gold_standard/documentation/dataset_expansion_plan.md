## Analysis Framework Consistency

Each gold standard entry should include:

1. **Song Information**
   - Title and Artist
   - Brief thematic description (no full lyrics)

2. **Theological Analysis**
   - Message summary
   - Biblical alignment assessment
   - Outsider interpretation considerations
   - Glorification of God evaluation

3. **Scoring Rationale**
   - Clear justification for score
   - Specific theological strengths/weaknesses
   - Verdict explanation

4. **Test Case Value**
   - What specific aspect this song tests
   - Expected model behavior
   - Common analysis pitfalls to avoid

## Implementation Approach

1. **Reference-Based Analysis:** Focus on song themes and theological content rather than reproducing lyrics
2. **Diverse Representation:** Include various artists, denominations, and musical styles
3. **Clear Scoring Criteria:** Ensure each score is well-justified and consistent
4. **Edge Case Coverage:** Include songs that test boundary conditions of the analysis framework

## Next Steps

1. Identify 10-15 additional songs across the categories above
2. Create analysis frameworks for each song
3. Validate scoring consistency across the dataset
4. Test the expanded dataset with the evaluation system
