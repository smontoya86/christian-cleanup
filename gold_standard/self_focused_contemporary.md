## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (3.5/10)
Songs in this category typically focus on personal experience, feelings, and what God can do for the individual rather than on God's character and glory. The central message often revolves around self-improvement, personal breakthrough, or emotional fulfillment rather than worship and surrender to God.

### Biblical Alignment (4.0/10)
While these songs may contain some biblical language, they often take verses out of context or emphasize secondary benefits of faith rather than primary gospel truths. The focus on personal experience over God's character represents a significant departure from biblical worship patterns.

### Outsider Interpretation (5.0/10)
These songs often sound like motivational or self-help content with religious language added. Non-Christians might interpret them as generic positive thinking or personal empowerment messages, missing any distinctly Christian content about sin, salvation, or God's holiness.

### Glorification of God (3.0/10)
The primary focus is typically on human experience, emotions, and personal benefit rather than God's character and glory. While God may be mentioned, He often serves as a means to personal ends rather than being the ultimate object of worship and adoration.

## Theological Concerns
Songs in this category often exhibit several problematic patterns including treating God as a means to personal ends, emphasizing human experience over divine character, lacking clear gospel content, focusing on temporal benefits rather than eternal truths, and using emotional manipulation rather than biblical truth.

## Test Criteria
Songs in this category should score in the Red range due to their fundamental theological problems. While they may contain some Christian language, the overall focus and message are problematic from a biblical worship perspective.

**Expected Score:** 4.2/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Red - Not recommended
