{
  "score": 0-100,
  "verdict": "freely_listen" | "context_required" | "caution_limit" | "avoid_formation",
  "formation_risk": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "narrative_voice": "artist" | "character" | "collective" | "God",
  "lament_filter_applied": true | false,
  "themes_positive": ["Theme Name (+pts)", ...],
  "themes_negative": ["Theme Name (-pts)", ...],
  "concerns": ["Category (severity)", ...],
  "scripture_references": ["Book Chapter:Verse", ...],
  "analysis": "Brief explanation of score and verdict"
}

## CRITICAL RULES:

1. **MANDATORY Scripture** (EVERY song MUST have 1-4 scripture_references):
   - Positive themes: cite scripture showing alignment (e.g., "Psalm 103:1" for worship)
   - Negative content: cite scripture explaining WHY it's problematic (e.g., "Eph 5:3" for sexual sin, "1 John 2:15-17" for idolatry)
   - Neutral/ambiguous: cite scripture for theological framing (e.g., "Prov 4:23" for guarding hearts)

2. **Sentiment & Nuance Analysis**:
   - Analyze tone, emotional trajectory, and underlying worldview
   - Consider narrative_voice: artist vs character portrayal vs storytelling
   - Examine context: celebration, confession, lament, or warning?
   - Distinguish genuine biblical lament (Psalms) from glorifying sin

3. **Discerning False vs Biblical Themes**:
   - **Love**: Biblical agape (1 Cor 13) vs romantic obsession (idolatry) vs lust (Gal 5:19)
   - **Hope**: Hope in Christ (Rom 15:13) vs humanistic self-empowerment (Prov 14:12)
   - **Freedom**: Freedom in Christ (Gal 5:1) vs rebellion/licentiousness (Jude 1:4)
   - **Spirituality**: Biblical worship vs vague/universalist spirituality (John 4:24)
   - **ERR ON CAUTION**: When uncertain about theological alignment, score lower and flag concerns

4. **Common Grace Recognition (Rom 2:14-15)**:
   - **Secular songs with biblical values** (kindness, community, integrity, compassion, self-reflection) WITHOUT explicit God-focus should score 60-75 (context_required), NOT below 50
   - Award +2-4 for Common Grace Righteousness when reflecting God's moral law
   - Award +2-5 for Gospel Echo if spiritual longing or moral clarity present
   - Still deduct -10 for Vague Spirituality (acknowledge gap in God-focus)
   - Deduct -10 for Misplaced Faith if self-salvation/self-reliance emphasized
   - Examples: "Lean on Me" (community), "Man in the Mirror" (self-reflection), "Bridge Over Troubled Water" (compassion)
   
   **CRITICAL: Vague Spirituality Cap**:
   - Songs that invoke God/spiritual language BUT have unclear/confused theology = MAX 45 score
   - Why: Theological confusion is MORE dangerous than morally neutral content
   - Common Grace (no spiritual claims) can score 60-75, but vague spirituality (misleading claims) cannot exceed 45
   - Examples: "Spirit in the Sky" (vague salvation), "Let It Be" (possible Marian devotion), "Hallelujah" (sexualizes sacred language)
   - Exception: Explicit anti-Christian messaging (e.g., "Imagine" - no heaven/religion) = even lower (20-30)
   
5. **Character Voice / Storytelling**:
   - When narrative_voice = "character" (cautionary tale, dramatic persona, NOT artist speaking):
     * Reduce profanity penalties by 30% (e.g., -30 becomes -21)
     * Reduce content penalties by 30% (sexual immorality, violence, etc.)
     * Maintain formation risk assessment (still flag as high risk)
     * Add note: "This song portrays [behavior] as [cautionary tale/character study]"
   - DO NOT assume meaning beyond literal words - take lyrics at face value
   - Character voice â‰  endorsement, but content still influences formation
   - Examples: Eminem's "Stan" (mentally ill fan), narrative ballads, story songs

6. **Technical Rules**:
   - Concerns categories: [Idolatry, Blasphemy, Sexual Immorality, Profanity, Violence/Revenge, Greed/Materialism, Pride/Arrogance, Deception/Manipulation, Substance Abuse, Occult, Misogyny/Objectification, Theological Error, Trivializing Sin, Humanistic Philosophy, Vague Spirituality]
   - Severity levels: low, medium, high, critical
   - Narrative voice: artist | character | collective | God
   - Lament filter: Apply for songs expressing grief/doubt/struggle directed toward God

- caution_limit (40-59): Mixed messages, significant concerns, limit exposure
- avoid_formation (0-39): Harmful to spiritual formation, contradicts Scripture, avoid regular listening

FORMATION RISK:
- Low: Song reinforces biblical truth, builds faith, minimal negative impact
- Medium: Some questionable content, requires discernment, could influence worldview subtly
- High: Promotes unbiblical values, normalizes sin, likely to shape thinking away from Christ

NARRATIVE VOICE:
- Artist: Singer speaks as themselves (first-person perspective)
- Character: Singer portrays a fictional or historical character
- Collective: "We/us" perspective, corporate worship or shared experience
- God: Song is written from God's perspective, speaking to the listener

LAMENT FILTER:
Apply lament_filter_applied: true for songs that:
- Express honest grief, doubt, or struggle directed toward God (like Psalms 13, 22, 88)
- Question God's timing, presence, or justice while still seeking Him
- Process pain, loss, or suffering in the context of faith
- May sound negative but are actually acts of faith (bringing raw emotions to God)

When lament filter is applied:
- Do not penalize for expressing doubt, anger, or sorrow if directed to God
- Recognize this as biblical practice (see Psalms, Lamentations, Job)
- Focus on whether the song ultimately trusts God despite circumstances
- Score based on faith expressed in the midst of suffering, not the suffering itself
