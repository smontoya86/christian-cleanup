## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (8.0/10)
The song focuses on the biblical imagery of Christ as both Lion of Judah and Lamb of God, celebrating His roles as conquering King and sacrificial Savior. The central message emphasizes Christ's victory and sacrifice, which is theologically sound and worship-appropriate.

### Biblical Alignment (7.5/10)
The song draws from biblical imagery found in Revelation 5:5-6 where Christ is described as both Lion of Judah and Lamb who was slain. The theological concept is accurate, though the song could provide more specific content about the implications of these dual roles.

### Outsider Interpretation (7.0/10)
While the song uses biblical imagery, the metaphorical language about "lion" and "lamb" might be interpreted in generic terms without understanding the specific biblical context. However, the worship context and references to victory maintain a generally Christian framework.

### Glorification of God (7.5/10)
The song focuses on Christ and His various roles, which is appropriate for worship. However, the emphasis on the imagery and metaphors sometimes overshadows deeper theological content about what Christ's roles as Lion and Lamb actually mean for believers.

## Theological Strengths
The song correctly uses biblical imagery to describe Christ's nature and work. It celebrates both His victory and sacrifice, maintaining a Christ-centered focus while drawing from rich biblical symbolism found in Revelation.

## Theological Concerns
The song could be more specific about the theological implications of Christ's dual roles. The emphasis on imagery and metaphor, while not wrong, could benefit from more explicit theological content about salvation, victory over sin, and Christ's kingship.

## Test Criteria
This song should score in the middle Purple range due to its good use of biblical imagery combined with limited theological depth. While it contains solid Christian content, it lacks the theological richness that would make it excellent.

**Expected Score:** 7.3/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Purple - Recommended with discernment
