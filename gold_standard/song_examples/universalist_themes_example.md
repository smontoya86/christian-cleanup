## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (3.0/10)
Songs in this category typically emphasize God's love and acceptance while avoiding clear biblical requirements for salvation. The central message often suggests that all people are automatically accepted by God without addressing sin, repentance, or faith in Christ specifically.

### Biblical Alignment (4.0/10)
While these songs may reference God's love (which is biblical), they often ignore the biblical balance of God's love and justice. They typically avoid clear biblical teachings about sin, repentance, faith in Christ, and the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus alone.

### Outsider Interpretation (6.0/10)
These songs often appeal to non-Christians because they present a non-threatening message of universal acceptance. However, this appeal comes at the cost of biblical clarity about the gospel, potentially giving false assurance to those who have not truly repented and believed.

### Glorification of God (4.0/10)
While these songs may mention God's love, they often present an incomplete picture of God's character that ignores His holiness, justice, and righteousness. This incomplete representation fails to give God the glory due to His full character and attributes.

## Theological Concerns
Songs in this category exhibit serious theological problems including presenting an incomplete gospel message, ignoring biblical requirements for salvation, emphasizing God's love while neglecting His holiness and justice, potentially giving false assurance to unbelievers, and contradicting Jesus' exclusive claims about salvation.

## Biblical Problems
Universalist themes contradict clear biblical teachings including Jesus' statement that He is the only way to the Father (John 14:6), the necessity of repentance and faith (Acts 17:30, Ephesians 2:8-9), the reality of judgment (Hebrews 9:27), and the exclusivity of salvation through Christ alone (Acts 4:12).

## Test Criteria
Songs in this category should score in the lower Red range due to their theological errors regarding salvation. While they may contain some positive elements about God's love, the fundamental misrepresentation of the gospel makes them spiritually dangerous.

**Expected Score:** 4.5/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Red - Not recommended
