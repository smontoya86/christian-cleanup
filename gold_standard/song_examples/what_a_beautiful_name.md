## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (8.5/10)
The song focuses on the power, beauty, and authority of Jesus' name, celebrating both His incarnation and resurrection. The central message emphasizes the significance of Christ's name and the victory He has won over sin and death, which is theologically sound and worship-focused.

### Biblical Alignment (8.0/10)
The song aligns well with biblical teachings about the power of Jesus' name (Philippians 2:9-11, Acts 4:12) and His victory over death (1 Corinthians 15:54-57). The references to incarnation and resurrection are biblically accurate, though the theological content could be more specific and detailed.

### Outsider Interpretation (7.0/10)
While the song clearly focuses on Jesus, some of the language about "beautiful name" and "wonderful name" could potentially be interpreted in generic spiritual terms. However, the specific references to death's defeat and resurrection maintain a distinctly Christian framework.

### Glorification of God (8.0/10)
The song is primarily focused on exalting Jesus and His name, which is appropriate for worship. However, the repetitive nature and emphasis on the aesthetic quality ("beautiful," "wonderful") sometimes shifts focus from theological content to emotional response.

## Theological Strengths
The song correctly emphasizes the power and authority of Jesus' name, celebrates His victory over death, and maintains a Christ-centered focus. The references to incarnation and resurrection are theologically accurate and worship-appropriate.

## Theological Concerns
The song's repetitive structure may prioritize emotional response over theological depth. While the content is good, it lacks the doctrinal richness that would make it excellent. The emphasis on the name's beauty rather than its meaning could be more substantial.

## Test Criteria
This song should score in the upper Purple range due to its solid theological content that lacks depth. While it contains good Christian themes and maintains a Christ-centered focus, the repetitive nature and limited theological development place it in the "good but requiring discernment" category.

**Expected Score:** 7.6/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Purple - Recommended with discernment
