## Lyrics

The secret side of me, I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it

It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls
It comes awake, and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this, make it end?

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

My secret side I keep, hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out, he'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this, make it end?

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I've gotta lose control, it's something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster

It's hiding in the dark, its teeth are razor sharp
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream
Or maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster!

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I've gotta lose control, it's something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster

## Analysis

This analysis is based on the Berean Test criteria, which evaluates songs on their biblical and theological integrity.

### 1. Message Communication (6/10)

The song's message revolves around an internal struggle with a hidden, darker side of the self, described as a "monster." The lyrics express feelings of being caged, out of control, and a desire to be saved from this internal turmoil. While not explicitly a gospel message, it powerfully communicates the human condition of struggling with sin and the flesh, a common theme in Christian theology.

### 2. Biblical Alignment (7/10)

The song's themes align with several biblical concepts:

*   **The Struggle with Sin (Romans 7:15-25):** The apostle Paul's description of his own struggle with sin mirrors the song's lyrics about an internal battle and doing what one does not want to do.
*   **The Concept of the "Flesh" (Galatians 5:17):** The "monster" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the sinful nature or the "flesh" that is at war with the Spirit.
*   **The Cry for a Savior (Romans 7:24-25):** The line "Why won't somebody come and save me from this?" echoes Paul's cry, "Who will deliver me from this body of death?" and points to the need for a savior.

However, the song does not explicitly mention God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, which, according to the Berean Test criteria, results in a 2-point penalty.

### 3. Outsider Interpretation (8/10)

To a non-Christian, the song is a powerful and relatable anthem about internal struggles, inner demons, and the feeling of being overwhelmed by one's own darker impulses. The metaphor of a "monster" is universally understood, and the song's raw emotion and energy have contributed to its mainstream success. The lack of explicit religious language makes it accessible to a broad audience, who can interpret it in a variety of ways, from a struggle with mental health to a battle with addiction.

### 4. Glorification of God (5/10)

While the song does not explicitly glorify God, it can be seen as doing so indirectly by highlighting the desperate need for a savior. By painting a vivid picture of the brokenness and darkness of the human condition, the song implicitly points to the need for redemption and grace. However, the lack of any explicit mention of God or a resolution through faith limits its ability to directly glorify Him.

## Final Score: 6.5/10 (Purple)

The song receives a moderate score. It is a powerful and biblically resonant song about the struggle with sin, but its lack of explicit Christian language and resolution prevents it from scoring higher. It is a great example of a crossover song that can be appreciated by both Christian and secular audiences.

## Corporate Worship Recommendation

Not recommended for corporate worship. The song's focus on internal struggle and its lack of explicit praise or worship of God make it unsuitable for a congregational setting.

## Theological Depth Rating

**Milk:** The song deals with the foundational Christian truth of the struggle with sin, but it does not delve into deeper theological concepts or offer a resolution.
