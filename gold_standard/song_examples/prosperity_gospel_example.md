## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (2.5/10)
Songs in this category typically present God primarily as a source of material blessing and prosperity. The central message often revolves around what God will do for the believer in terms of health, wealth, and success, rather than focusing on God's character, holiness, or the gospel of salvation.

### Biblical Alignment (3.0/10)
While these songs may reference biblical promises about God's provision, they often take verses out of context and emphasize material blessings over spiritual truths. The focus on prosperity contradicts biblical teachings about suffering, sacrifice, and the temporary nature of earthly wealth.

### Outsider Interpretation (5.0/10)
These songs often sound like motivational or success-oriented content with religious language. Non-Christians might interpret them as "name it and claim it" philosophy or positive thinking with spiritual terminology, missing any distinctly Christian content about sin, salvation, or discipleship.

### Glorification of God (3.0/10)
The primary focus is typically on what God can provide materially rather than on His character, holiness, or glory. God is often presented as a means to prosperity rather than as the ultimate object of worship and devotion, fundamentally misrepresenting the nature of true worship.

## Theological Concerns
Songs in this category exhibit serious theological problems including treating God as a cosmic vending machine, emphasizing material over spiritual blessings, contradicting biblical teachings about suffering and sacrifice, promoting a transactional view of faith, and misrepresenting the gospel message.

## Biblical Problems
The prosperity gospel contradicts numerous biblical teachings including Jesus' warnings about wealth (Matthew 6:19-21), Paul's contentment in all circumstances (Philippians 4:11-13), the reality of Christian suffering (2 Timothy 3:12), and the call to take up one's cross (Luke 9:23).

## Test Criteria
Songs in this category should score in the lower Red range due to their fundamental theological errors. They represent a distortion of the gospel that can be spiritually harmful and misleading to believers and non-believers alike.

**Expected Score:** 3.8/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Red - Not recommended
