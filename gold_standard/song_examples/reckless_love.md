## Lyrics

Verse 1
Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Chorus
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ‘til I’m found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it, I don’t deserve it, still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Verse 2
When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Bridge
There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me

## Analysis

This analysis is based on the Berean Test criteria, which evaluates songs on their biblical and theological integrity.

### 1. Message Communication (8/10)

The song's central message is the overwhelming, unconditional, and pursuing love of God. It effectively communicates that this love is not earned or deserved, but freely given. The use of the word "reckless" is intended to describe a love that is so passionate and unconcerned with the cost that it appears reckless from a human perspective. While the term has been a point of contention, the overall message aligns with the biblical portrayal of God's passionate love for humanity.

### 2. Biblical Alignment (9/10)

The lyrics are rich with biblical allusions:

*   **The Parable of the Lost Sheep (Luke 15:4-7):** The line "leaves the ninety-nine" is a direct reference to this parable, illustrating God's desire to seek and save the lost.
*   **God's Love for His Enemies (Romans 5:8):** The lyric "When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me" reflects the biblical truth that Christ died for us while we were still sinners.
*   **God's Omnipresence and Pursuit (Psalm 139):** The bridge, with its imagery of lighting up shadows and climbing mountains, echoes the language of Psalm 139, which speaks of God's inescapable presence and pursuit.

The primary theological debate surrounds the word "reckless." Critics argue that God's love is purposeful and not careless. However, proponents argue that the term effectively captures the scandalous nature of God's grace from a human standpoint.

### 3. Outsider Interpretation (7/10)

A non-Christian might find the term "reckless love" jarring or confusing, potentially misinterpreting it as God being impulsive or careless. However, the lyrical context, which speaks of a love that "chases me down" and "fights 'til I'm found," provides a framework for understanding the term as a metaphor for an intense and passionate love. The narrative of the lost sheep is also a universally understandable story of value and redemption.

### 4. Glorification of God (9/10)

The song overwhelmingly glorifies God by focusing on the extravagant and unconditional nature of His love. It portrays God as a loving, pursuing Father who relentlessly seeks out His children. The song inspires a sense of awe and gratitude for God's love, which is a key element of glorifying Him.

## Final Score: 8.25/10 (Green)

The song receives a high score for its strong biblical themes and its powerful message of God's pursuing love. While the use of the word "reckless" can be a point of discussion, the overall lyrical content is theologically sound and glorifying to God.

## Corporate Worship Recommendation

Recommended for corporate worship. The song is musically accessible and proclaims the value and worth of God's love. The theological depth is suitable for a general congregation, and the message is one of hope and encouragement.

## Theological Depth Rating

**Mixed:** The song contains both foundational Christian truths (God's love) and deeper theological concepts (the scandal of grace).
