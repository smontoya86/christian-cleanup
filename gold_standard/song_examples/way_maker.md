You are here, moving in our midst
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, working in this place
I worship You, I worship You

Way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper
Light in the darkness, my God, that is who You are

This analysis is based on the Berean Test criteria, which evaluates songs on their biblical and theological integrity.

### 1. Message Communication (10/10)

The song's message is a clear and powerful declaration of God's character and attributes. It communicates a message of faith and trust in God's ability to make a way, work miracles, keep promises, and be a light in the darkness. The repetition of "That is who You are" reinforces the song's focus on God's nature. The explicit mention of "Jesus" as the answer to all things solidifies the song's Christ-centered message.

### 2. Biblical Alignment (10/10)

The song is deeply rooted in Scripture, with each of the titles for God having a strong biblical basis:

*   **Way Maker (Isaiah 43:19):** "Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert."
*   **Miracle Worker (Psalm 77:14):** "You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples."
*   **Promise Keeper (2 Corinthians 1:20):** "For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory."
*   **Light in the Darkness (John 8:12):** "Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’"
