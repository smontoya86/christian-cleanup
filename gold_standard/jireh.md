## Lyrics

_I’ll never be more loved than I am right now_
_Wasn’t holding You up so there’s nothing I can do to let You down_
_Doesn’t take a trophy to make You proud_
_I’ll never be more loved than I am right now_

_Going through a storm but I won’t go down_
_I hear Your voice carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out_
_You would cross an ocean so I wouldn’t drown_
_You’ve never been closer than You are right now_

_Jireh You are enough_
_Jireh You are enough_
_I will be content in every circumstance_
_Jireh You are enough_

_I don’t wanna forget how I feel right now_
_On the mountaintop I can see so clear what it’s all about_
_Stay by my side when the sun goes down_
_Don’t wanna forget how I feel right now_

_Jireh You are enough_
_Jireh You are enough_
_I will be content in every circumstance_
_Jireh You are enough_

_I’m already loved_
_I’m already chosen_
_I know who I am_
_I know what You’ve spoken_
_I’m already loved_
_More than I could imagine_
_And that is enough_

_That is enough_
_That is enough_
_That is enough_
_That is enough_
_That is enough_
_That is enough_
_You are enough_
_You are enough_
_You are enough_
_You are enough_
_You are enough_
_So I am enough_
_You are enough_
_So I am enough_

_If He dresses the lilies with beauty and splendor_
_How much more will He clothe you_
_How much more will He clothe you_
_If He watches over every sparrow_
_How much more does He love you_
_How much more does He love you_

_More than you ask, think or imagine_
_According to His power working in us_
_It’s more than enough_

_It’s more than enough_
_It’s more than enough_
