**NOTE:** Since there are two artists, I will refer to them as Elevation and Maverick throughout this review.

**Note to new users: This is a different kind of review site!  Read About the Berean Test and Evaluation Criteria prior to reading this review.  I strongly encourage you to consider the potential blessings and dangers of this artist‘s theology by visiting Resources.**

### 1. What message does the song communicate?

This song’s primary points are:

*   They are loved by God
*   God is their provider
*   God is enough, in fact, more than enough

It also makes other points about God, themselves, and other statements that are erroneous or unclear:

**God:**

*   Does not love more or less based on performance
*   Cannot be forced to descend because of man
*   Will say “Good and faithful servant” to good and faithful servants
*   Knows
*   Power made perfect in us

**Themselves:**

*   They do not always put God first
*   Are adopted children of God

**Erroneous/Unclear:**

*   Potential Word of Faith proclamation, that God will rescue them from their problems.  Sometimes God allows us to struggle to make us better people.

**Side Note:** To those sensitive to massive repetition, Bridge 1 essentially repeats the same seven lines three times.  In Refrain 1, the phrase “That is enough” appears 16 times, often in succession, before switching to “You are enough” which appears 10 times.  Bridge 2 and Refrain 2 also heavily rely on repetition with little new information to add.

Score: **9/10**

### 2. How much of the lyrics line up with Scripture?

All of this song is Biblical.

**[Verse 1]**

Line 1: God’s love does not change because He does not change (Numbers 23:19, Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 13:8, and James 1:17).

Line 2:  Elevation and Maverick haven’t always lived for God (Genesis 8:21, Job 15:14-16, Psalm 14:2-3, Psalm 51:5, Proverbs 22:15, Jeremiah 17:9, Romans 3:10-18, Romans 3:23, Romans 5:12, Romans 6:23, and Ephesians 2:2-3).

Line 3: Elevation and Maverick cannot lower God’s position.  This is so because God is sovereign (Genesis 1:1, Deuteronomy 4:39, Deuteronomy 10:14, Joshua 2:11, Nehemiah 9:6, Psalm 29:10, Psalm 45:6, Psalm 50:7-15, Psalm 93:1-2, Psalm 115:3, Psalm 135:6, Isaiah 43:13, Isaiah 45:9-10, Isaiah 46:10, Lamentations 5:19, Daniel 4:35, Romans 9:19-21, Ephesians 1:11, Hebrews 1:8, James 4:15, Revelation 4:11, and Revelation 20:11).

Lines 4 and 5: See line 1.

Line 6: Repeats line 1, with a small Casper the friendly ghost reference.

**[Verse 2]**

Lines 1-4: How do Elevation and Maverick know that God will rescue them from their storm?  Perhaps He will allow it to better their character (Romans 5:3-5, Hebrews 12:4-11, and James 1:2-4).  This potentially falls in line with the Word of Faith error.  Alternatively, one could interpret this as “spiritual death”, which would align with John 6:39, John 17:12, and John 18:9.

Line 5: In terms of personal relationship, this moment is the closest Elevation and Maverick have been to God.

**[Chorus]**

Line 1: Appeal to the crowd to join in singing.

Line 2: To be more specific, Jehovah-Jireh (or YHVH yir-eh), which means “The Lord Provides” (Genesis 22:14).  He is their portion (Numbers 18:20, Deuteronomy 10:9, Deuteronomy 18:2, Joshua 13:33, Psalm 16:5, Psalm 23:5, Psalm 73:26, Psalm 142:5, Psalm 119:57, Psalm 142:5, Lamentations 3:24, and Ezekiel 44:28).

Line 3: Essentially repeats line 2.

Lines 4 and 5: Elevation and Maverick obey Philippians 4:11-13.

Line 6: Essentially repeats line 2.

**[Post-Chorus]**

Line 1: See Chorus, line 2.

Line 2: There is an overflow of blessing from God that transcends Elevation and Maverick’s requests (Psalm 23:5 and Ephesians 3:20).

Lines 3 and 4: Repeats lines 1 and 2.

**[Verse 3]**

Lines 1 and 2: That, is, loved (see Verse 1, line 1).

Line 3: That is, Jireh is enough.  See Chorus, line 2.

Line 4: I’m not sure why they would add “when the sun goes down” because God is with them.  Period (Deuteronomy 31:6-8, Joshua 1:5-9, Psalm 23:4, Psalm 46:1, Psalm 139:7-10, Isaiah 41:10, Jeremiah 23:23-24, Zephaniah 3:17, Matthew 6:25-34, Matthew 28:20, John 14:16-17, Hebrews 13:5, Romans 8:38-39, and Revelation 3:20).  But, adding a qualifier doesn’t make it untrue.

Line 5: Essentially repeats line 1.

**[Bridge 1]**

Line 1: See Verse 1, line 1.

Line 2: That is, adopted (John 1:12-13, John 14:18, Romans 8:14-17, Romans 8:23, Romans 9:1-8, Galatians 3:26, Galatians 4:5-7, Ephesians 1:3-14, Ephesians 2:11-22, Hebrews 9:15, and 1 John 3:1-3).

Lines 3 and 4: That is, loved, based on lines 5 and 6.  See Verse 1, line 1.

Line 5: See Verse 1, line 1.

Line 6: See Post-Chorus, line 2.

Line 7: See Post-Chorus, line 1.  Combined with another slight Casper reference.

Lines 8-23: Essentially repeats lines 1-7.

Line 24: That is, God knows all the things Elevation and Maverick described in lines 1-7.  This is implicit because God knows everything (1 Kings 8:39, 1 Chronicles 28:9, Psalm 44:21, Psalm 139:4, Psalm 147:4-5, Isaiah 40:28, Matthew 10:30, John 16:30, John 21:17, Acts 1:24, Hebrews 4:13, and 1 John 3:20).

**[Refrain 1]**

Line 1: Essentially repeats Bridge 1, line 7.

Line 2: That is, the truth that Elevation and Maverick are loved.  See Verse 1, line 2.

Line 3: Essentially repeats Bridge 1, line 7.

Line 4: See line 2.

Lines 5-7: Essentially repeats Bridge 1, line 7.

Line 8: That is, YHVH.  See relevant link in Chorus, line 2.

Line 9: This is one of God’s names that appears in Genesis 17:1 and Genesis 35:11.  It is commonly translated as “God Almighty”, but is probably better understood as All-Sufficient One.

Line 10: God is most important to Elevation and Maverick (Philippians 3:8-10).

Line 11: Clarifies the “You” in line 10 as Jesus.

Line 12: Essentially repeats Bridge 1, line 7.

Line 13: Line 3: See Post-Chorus, line 1.

Lines 14 and 15: See Chorus, line 2.

Line 16: Essentially repeats Post-Chorus, line 2.

Line 17: See Post-Chorus, line 1.

Line 18: This line recognizes that Elevation and Maverick are enough because God paid their penalty (Isaiah 53:1-12, Matthew 20:28, Mark 10:45, John 1:29, John 3:16, John 19:30, Acts 4:12, Acts 20:28, Romans 5:6-10, Romans 6:23, 1 Corinthians 1:30, 1 Corinthians 6:20, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Galatians 1:3-4, Galatians 3:13, Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 2:14, 1 Peter 2:24, 1 Peter 3:18, 1 John 2:2, and 1 John 4:10).
