## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (7.5/10)
The song uses the metaphor of Peter walking on water to encourage faith and trust in God during uncertain times. The central message is about stepping out in faith when God calls, even when circumstances seem impossible or frightening.

### Biblical Alignment (6.8/10)
The song draws from the biblical account of Peter walking on water (Matthew 14:22-33), which provides a solid foundation. However, the application sometimes focuses more on human experience and emotion than on God's character and promises. The theological content is present but could be more explicitly Christ-centered.

### Outsider Interpretation (6.0/10)
While the song contains Christian themes, some of the language could be interpreted in a generic spiritual sense. The focus on personal experience and "stepping out" might resonate with non-Christian self-help or motivational contexts, potentially diluting the specifically Christian message.

### Glorification of God (6.8/10)
The song does acknowledge God's sovereignty and faithfulness, but the primary focus tends to be on human experience and emotion rather than God's character. While it encourages trust in God, it could be more explicitly God-centered in its approach.

## Theological Strengths
The song encourages genuine faith and trust in God during difficult circumstances. It draws from a legitimate biblical narrative and promotes dependence on God rather than self-reliance. The call to step out in faith when God leads is biblically sound.

## Theological Concerns
The song's focus tends toward human experience and emotion rather than God's character and promises. Some of the language could be interpreted in non-Christian contexts. The emphasis on "calling me deeper" and personal spiritual experience might overshadow the objective truths of the gospel.

## Test Criteria
This song should score in the Purple range due to its mixed theological content. While it contains legitimate Christian themes and biblical references, the human-centered focus and potential for misinterpretation place it in the "good but requiring discernment" category.

**Expected Score:** 6.8/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Purple - Recommended with discernment
