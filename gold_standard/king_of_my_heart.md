## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (7.5/10)
The song expresses a personal relationship with God, acknowledging Him as King while emphasizing intimacy and trust. The central message is about surrendering one's heart to God and finding security in His love and faithfulness, which contains good theological elements.

### Biblical Alignment (6.8/10)
The song contains biblical themes about God as King and the importance of surrendering to Him. However, the emphasis on personal feelings and intimate relationship sometimes lacks the biblical balance of reverence and awe that should accompany intimacy with the holy God.

### Outsider Interpretation (6.0/10)
The language about "King of my heart" and personal relationship could potentially be interpreted in romantic or generic spiritual terms. The focus on feelings and personal experience might allow for non-Christian interpretations of divine relationship that miss the gospel foundation.

### Glorification of God (6.5/10)
While the song acknowledges God as King, the primary focus is on the believer's experience of relationship rather than God's character and glory. The emphasis on personal feelings and benefits sometimes overshadows the objective truths about God's nature and work.

## Theological Strengths
The song correctly acknowledges God's sovereignty and the importance of surrender. It promotes trust in God and recognizes His faithfulness, which are biblically sound themes. The desire for close relationship with God reflects appropriate spiritual longing.

## Theological Concerns
The emphasis on personal experience and feelings could overshadow objective theological truth. The intimate language, while not necessarily wrong, might lack appropriate reverence for God's holiness. The focus on what God does for the believer rather than who God is represents a theological imbalance.

## Test Criteria
This song should score in the lower Purple range due to its mixed theological content. While it contains some good themes about God's sovereignty and faithfulness, the emphasis on personal experience and potential for misinterpretation place it in the "requiring discernment" category.

**Expected Score:** 6.9/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Purple - Recommended with discernment
