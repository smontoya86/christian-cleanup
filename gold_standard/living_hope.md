## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (8.2/10)
The song focuses on the resurrection of Christ and the hope it provides for believers. The central message emphasizes Christ's victory over death and the living hope that believers have through His resurrection, which is theologically sound and gospel-centered.

### Biblical Alignment (8.0/10)
The song aligns well with biblical teachings about Christ's resurrection (1 Corinthians 15) and the hope it provides (1 Peter 1:3). The emphasis on victory over death and the power of resurrection reflects solid biblical theology, though the content could be more specific about the implications of the resurrection.

### Outsider Interpretation (7.5/10)
While the song clearly focuses on Christian themes of resurrection and hope, some of the language about "living hope" and victory could potentially be interpreted in generic motivational terms. However, the specific references to Christ and resurrection maintain a distinctly Christian framework.

### Glorification of God (7.8/10)
The song focuses on Christ's work and victory, which is appropriate for worship. However, there's some emphasis on the benefits believers receive ("my living hope," "hallelujah, praise the One") that sometimes shifts focus from Christ's character to human experience of His benefits.

## Theological Strengths
The song correctly emphasizes the resurrection as central to Christian faith and hope. It celebrates Christ's victory over death and maintains a generally Christ-centered focus while providing encouragement about the hope believers have in Christ.

## Theological Concerns
The song could be more specific about the theological implications of the resurrection. The emphasis on personal experience of hope, while not wrong, could overshadow the objective reality of Christ's work. The repetitive nature may prioritize emotional response over theological depth.

## Test Criteria
This song should score in the upper Purple range due to its solid resurrection theology combined with some limitations in depth and focus. While it contains good Christian content, it lacks the theological richness that would make it excellent.

**Expected Score:** 7.8/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Purple - Recommended with discernment
