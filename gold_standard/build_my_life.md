## Expected Analysis Framework

### Message (8.0/10)
The song expresses a desire for complete surrender and dedication to Christ, using the metaphor of building one's life on the foundation of Jesus. The central message is about making Christ the cornerstone of one's life and surrendering everything to Him in worship and service.

### Biblical Alignment (7.5/10)
The song draws from biblical imagery of Christ as cornerstone (1 Peter 2:6, Ephesians 2:20) and the concept of surrender and dedication to God (Romans 12:1). The theological foundation is sound, though the application sometimes focuses more on human action and commitment than on God's grace and work.

### Outsider Interpretation (7.0/10)
While the song contains Christian language and themes, some of the surrender and dedication language could potentially be interpreted in generic spiritual or self-improvement contexts. The focus on personal commitment might overshadow the gospel message for some listeners.

### Glorification of God (7.5/10)
The song does focus on Christ as worthy of complete surrender and dedication. However, there's a significant emphasis on human action and commitment ("I will build my life," "I surrender") that sometimes shifts focus from God's character and work to human response and effort.

## Theological Strengths
The song correctly emphasizes Christ as the foundation for life and encourages appropriate surrender and dedication to God. The desire for holiness and complete commitment to Christ reflects biblical values and proper worship response.

## Theological Concerns
The emphasis on human action and commitment could overshadow the gospel of grace. The focus on what the believer will do rather than what Christ has done might promote a works-based understanding of the Christian life. The repetitive nature may prioritize emotional response over theological content.

## Test Criteria
This song should score in the middle Purple range due to its good intentions and biblical imagery combined with potential theological imbalances. While it encourages appropriate surrender to Christ, the emphasis on human commitment over divine grace places it in the "good but requiring discernment" category.

**Expected Score:** 7.4/10  
**Expected Verdict:** Purple - Recommended with discernment
