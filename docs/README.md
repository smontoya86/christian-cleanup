### Key Architectural Principles

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Eliminated 52,010+ lines of over-engineered code
- **Educational Focus**: All analysis designed for discernment training
- **Production Ready**: Horizontal scaling with Docker containers
- **AI-Powered**: Router-based LLM analysis (Runpod/Ollama) for nuanced analysis
- **Biblical Foundation**: All analysis rooted in scriptural principles

### Major Simplification Achievement

- **Before**: 15+ complex orchestration components with multiple abstraction layers
- **After**: 2 core services (`SimplifiedChristianAnalysisService` + `UnifiedAnalysisService`)
- **Result**: 87% complexity reduction while maintaining all functionality and improving quality

## Getting Started
