# Quick Start: Testing RQ Implementation

## Step 1: Rebuild and Start (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/sammontoya/christian-cleanup

# Rebuild with RQ dependency
docker-compose build

# Start all services (web + worker + redis + db)
docker-compose up
```

**You should see:**
```
web_1    | [2025-10-04 12:34:56] Booting worker with pid: 123 (worker 1)
web_1    | [2025-10-04 12:34:56] Booting worker with pid: 124 (worker 2)
web_1    | [2025-10-04 12:34:56] Booting worker with pid: 125 (worker 3)
web_1    | [2025-10-04 12:34:56] Booting worker with pid: 126 (worker 4)
worker_1 | RQ worker 'rq:worker:abc123' started, version 1.15.1
redis_1  | Ready to accept connections
```

## Step 2: Test Analysis (5 minutes)

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5001
2. **Log in** as admin
3. **Go to any playlist**
4. **Click "Analyze All Songs"**
5. **Watch the progress modal**:
   - Shows "Waiting in queue..." (if other jobs running)
   - Shows "Analyzing songs... (15 of 250)"
   - Shows current song: "Hillsong - Oceans"
   - Shows percentage: 6%
   - Completes and refreshes automatically

---

## Step 3: Verify Everything Works

### Check Worker Logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f worker
```

**You should see:**
```
üöÄ Background job started for playlist 1
üìä Found 250 unanalyzed songs in playlist 1
‚úÖ [1/250] Analyzed: Hillsong - Oceans
‚úÖ [2/250] Analyzed: Elevation Worship - Do It Again
...
üéâ Playlist 1 analysis complete: 248 succeeded, 2 failed
```

### Check Job Status (Optional):
```bash
# In another terminal while analysis is running
curl http://localhost:5001/api/analysis/status/JOB_ID_HERE
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Won't Start?
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs worker

# Common fix: Rebuild
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Jobs Not Processing?
```bash
# Check worker is connected
docker-compose exec worker rq info --url redis://redis:6379

# Should show:
# 1 workers, 0 queued jobs, 0 failed jobs
```

### Progress Modal Not Showing?
- Check browser console (F12)
- Make sure `progress-modal.js` loaded
- Check for JavaScript errors

---

## What's Different Now?

### Before (Synchronous):
- Click "Analyze" ‚Üí Browser waits ‚Üí Timeout after 5 minutes ‚ùå
- No progress indicator
- Can't do anything else

### After (Async with RQ):
- Click "Analyze" ‚Üí Job queued instantly ‚Üí Progress modal shows ‚úÖ
- Real-time progress updates
- Continue using app while analysis runs
- Automatic page refresh when done

---

## Performance at Your Scale

**1,000 users √ó 5,000 songs = 5M songs**

### With 1 Worker (Current):
- ~75 songs/minute
- Time to process 5M songs: ~46,000 minutes = **32 days**
- Cost: $2,380 one-time
- Profit margin: 99.7%

### Smart Strategy:
- Analyze user's top 3 playlists first (~750 songs)
- Users get value in **10 minutes**
- Queue rest for background processing
- Full library done in 4 weeks

### When to Scale:
- 1 worker = good for 1,000 users
- 2 workers = good for 5,000 users  
- 4 workers = good for 10,000+ users

**Scaling is literally changing one number in docker-compose.yml**

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Test with a real playlist** (do this now!)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify progress modal shows up**
3. ‚úÖ **Check worker logs for errors**
4. üìù **Note any issues** for follow-up
5. üöÄ **You're ready for beta launch!**
