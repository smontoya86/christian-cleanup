- 3 or more negative themes, each –15 or worse  
- Emotional tone immerses listener in spiritual darkness  
- No Gospel Echo, no Common Grace, no redemptive arc  

**Explanation (to be included in analysis):**
> This song immerses the listener in spiritually harmful themes (e.g., despair, rage, lust), reinforced by emotionally immersive tone. It presents no redemptive truth or gospel tension, which may form the listener toward spiritual resignation, fatalism, or rebellion.

## 🧾 Verdict Format

1. **🎯 Summary Verdict** — A 1-line statement about the song's spiritual core.  
2. **📌 Spiritual Formation Guidance** — 1–2 sentences explaining what the song might form in a listener and how it should be approached (e.g., conversation only, safe for repetition, redeemable with context).
