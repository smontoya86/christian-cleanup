## ‚úÖ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### **1. Database Field Mismatches (CRITICAL) - FIXED**
- **Issue**: PlaylistSyncService used `user_id` but model uses `owner_id`
- **Fix**: Changed all references to use correct `owner_id` field
- **Impact**: Prevents duplicate playlists and database constraint violations

### **2. Undefined Function Calls (CRITICAL) - FIXED**  
- **Issue**: Calls to non-existent `get_user_playlists()` and `get_playlist_tracks()`
- **Fix**: Replaced with proper SpotifyService method calls
- **Impact**: Eliminates NameError exceptions that would crash sync operations

### **3. Missing Constructor Error Handling (CRITICAL) - FIXED**
- **Issue**: SpotifyService constructor could fail silently
- **Fix**: Added proper exception handling with clear error messages
- **Impact**: Better error reporting for token/configuration issues

### **4. Database Transaction Safety (HIGH) - FIXED**
- **Issue**: Token refresh lacked proper transaction rollback
- **Fix**: Added rollback on failure to prevent data corruption
- **Impact**: Ensures database consistency during token operations

### **5. Performance Issues (MEDIUM) - OPTIMIZED**
- **Issue**: Individual database flushes causing performance bottlenecks
- **Fix**: Implemented batch operations for songs and playlist relationships
- **Impact**: Improved sync performance for large playlists
