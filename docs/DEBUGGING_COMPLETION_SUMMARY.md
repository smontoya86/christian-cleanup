## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### New Database Utilities Created
```python
# Core Operations
get_by_id(model_class, id_value)
get_by_filter(model_class, **filters) 
get_all_by_filter(model_class, **filters)
count_by_filter(model_class, **filters)

# Advanced Operations  
exists_by_filter(model_class, **filters)
bulk_get_by_ids(model_class, ids)
get_or_create(model_class, defaults, **filters)

# Safety & Monitoring
health_check()
db_transaction_safe()
safe_add_and_commit(obj)
```

### Files Modernized

### Pattern Migration Examples
```python
# Before (SQLAlchemy 1.x)
song = Song.query.get(song_id)
songs = Song.query.filter_by(artist="Test").all()
count = Song.query.filter_by(explicit=True).count()

# After (SQLAlchemy 2.0)  
song = get_by_id(Song, song_id)
songs = get_all_by_filter(Song, artist="Test")
count = count_by_filter(Song, explicit=True)
```
