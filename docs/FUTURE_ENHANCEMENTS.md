- **A/B Testing**: No capability for gradual feature rollouts
- **Risk Management**: All features deployed to all users simultaneously

#### **Proposed Implementation**
```python
# app/utils/feature_flags.py
from enum import Enum
import redis
from flask import current_user

class FeatureFlag(Enum):
    PAGINATION_ENABLED = "pagination_enabled"
    ADVANCED_CACHING = "advanced_caching"
    NEW_ANALYSIS_ENGINE = "new_analysis_engine"
    COMMUNITY_FEATURES = "community_features"

class FeatureFlagService:
    def __init__(self, redis_client):
        self.redis = redis_client
    
    def is_enabled(self, flag: FeatureFlag, user_id: str = None) -> bool:
        """Check if feature flag is enabled for user/globally"""
        # Global flag check
        global_key = f"feature_flag:{flag.value}:global"
        if self.redis.get(global_key) == "true":
            return True
        
        # User-specific flag check
        if user_id:
            user_key = f"feature_flag:{flag.value}:user:{user_id}"
            return self.redis.get(user_key) == "true"
        
        return False
    
    def enable_for_percentage(self, flag: FeatureFlag, percentage: int):
        """Enable feature for percentage of users"""
        # Implementation for gradual rollouts
        pass
```

#### **Template Integration**
```html
<!-- templates/dashboard.html -->
{% if feature_flags.is_enabled('PAGINATION_ENABLED') %}
    {% include 'components/pagination.html' %}
{% endif %}
```

#### **Admin Interface**
```python
# app/admin/routes.py
@admin_bp.route('/feature-flags')
@admin_required
def feature_flags():
    """Admin interface for managing feature flags"""
    flags = FeatureFlagService.get_all_flags()
    return render_template('admin/feature_flags.html', flags=flags)
```

#### **Benefits**
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Test features with subset of users
