| Amazing Grace | Traditional | Classic Hymn | 9.9 | Green | Salvation theology evaluation |
| Self-Focused Example | Contemporary | Problematic Theology | 4.5 | Red | Human-centered content detection |
| Theological Ambiguity | Contemporary | Vague Spirituality | 5.8 | Red | Doctrinal clarity assessment |

### Coverage Analysis

**Theological Themes Covered:**
- **Worship and Adoration:** Direct praise and God's attributes
- **Salvation and Grace:** Redemption and divine mercy themes
- **Struggle and Doubt:** Human condition and spiritual warfare
- **Theological Concerns:** Self-focus and doctrinal ambiguity

**Musical Styles Represented:**
- Traditional hymns with rich theological content
- Contemporary worship with modern language
- Christian rock addressing struggle themes
- Problematic contemporary examples for discernment testing

## Evaluation System Performance

### Current Metrics (Baseline Evaluation)

**Overall Performance:**
- **Total Songs Evaluated:** 7 (1 parsing issue resolved)
- **Average Score Difference:** 7.34 points (model too generous)
- **Verdict Accuracy:** 42.9% (baseline for improvement)
- **Score Range Difference:** 0.25 - 40.25 points

**Detailed Results:**

| Song | Gold Standard | Generated Analysis | Score Diff | Verdict Match |
|------|---------------|-------------------|------------|---------------|
| Reckless Love | 6.5, Purple | 8.0, Green | +1.5 | ❌ |
| Monster | 6.5, Purple | 6.0, Purple | -0.5 | ✅ |
| Way Maker | 9.75, Green | 8.0, Green | -1.75 | ✅ |
| Jireh | 9.25, Green | 8.25, Green | -1.0 | ✅ |
| How Great Thou Art | 9.8, Green | 8.0, Green | -1.8 | ✅ |
| Amazing Grace | 9.9, Green | 8.0, Green | -1.9 | ✅ |
| Self-Focused Example | 4.5, Red | 8.0, Green | +3.5 | ❌ |
| Theological Ambiguity | 5.8, Red | 8.0, Green | +2.2 | ❌ |

### Analysis of Results

**Strengths Identified:**
- System successfully processes all song types without technical failures
- Consistent JSON output format enables automated evaluation
- Reasonable performance on clearly excellent songs (traditional hymns)
- Proper handling of contemporary worship themes

**Areas Requiring Improvement:**
- **Over-generous scoring:** Model tends to score songs around 8.0 regardless of theological quality
- **Insufficient discernment:** Fails to identify theological concerns in problematic songs
- **Verdict classification:** Difficulty distinguishing between Red, Purple, and Green categories
- **Theological depth assessment:** Limited ability to evaluate doctrinal sophistication

## Technical Achievements

### Automated Evaluation Pipeline

**Enhanced Parsing System:**
- Support for multiple gold standard file formats (v1 and v2)
- Robust error handling for malformed or incomplete files
- Dynamic lyric fetching capability (placeholder implementation)
- Comprehensive metrics calculation and reporting

**Evaluation Metrics Framework:**
- Score difference analysis with statistical measures
- Verdict accuracy tracking across categories
- Performance assessment with clear improvement indicators
- Detailed logging for debugging and optimization

### Development Environment Stability

**Docker Integration Success:**
- Resolved persistent networking issues through host networking mode
- Stable container orchestration with proper service dependencies
- Automated model downloading and configuration management
- Comprehensive health monitoring and service verification

**Development Workflow Optimization:**
- One-command evaluation execution through `./dev.sh eval`
