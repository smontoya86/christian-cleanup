## 🛑 Formational Weight Multiplier (–10)

**When It Applies:**
- 3 or more negative themes, each –15 or worse
- Emotional tone immerses listener in spiritual darkness
- No Gospel Echo, no Common Grace, no redemptive arc

**Explanation (to be included in analysis):**
> This song immerses the listener in spiritually harmful themes (e.g., despair, rage, lust), reinforced by emotionally immersive tone. It presents no redemptive truth or gospel tension, which may form the listener toward spiritual resignation, fatalism, or rebellion.

## 🎯 Theological Significance Weighting

**Core Gospel Themes (1.5x multiplier):**
- Christ-Centered, Gospel Presentation, Redemption, Repentance
- These themes receive enhanced weighting due to their salvific importance

**Character Formation Themes (1.2x multiplier):**
- Hope, Humility, Sacrificial Love, Forgiveness, Endurance, Obedience
- These themes shape Christian character and discipleship

**Common Grace Themes (1.0x multiplier):**
- Justice, Mercy, Truth, Peace, Community
- These reflect God's general revelation and moral order

### ⚖️ Final Score: 100 (Capped)

### 🧾 Verdict:

### 🛑 Formational Weight Multiplier Applied (–10)

### ⚖️ Final Score: 35

### 🧾 Verdict:
**Summary:** Spiritually crushing and directionless.
**Spiritual Guidance:** Lament without hope becomes spiritual dead weight. This is not a safe companion for sorrow. Avoid for formation; use only as a bridge to gospel conversations.

- Hope (+6)
- Gospel Echo (+3)

### ⚖️ Final Score: 86

### 🧾 Verdict:
**Summary:** Morally uplifting, spiritually vague.
**Spiritual Guidance:** Encouraging in tone, but lacks doctrinal clarity or saving truth. Listeners should beware mistaking inspiration for spiritual substance.

### **Phase 2: Custom Model Training (OpenAI gpt-oss-20b)**
- **Fine-Tuning Approach**: Train on collected dataset with theological labels
- **Single Model Architecture**: Replace 4 HuggingFace models with 1 custom model
- **Local Deployment**: Eliminate API costs and rate limits
- **Performance Optimization**: Target 20B parameter model for laptop compatibility

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- **Contextual Understanding**: Better nuance detection in complex lyrics
- **Genre-Specific Analysis**: Tailored evaluation criteria by music style

- **Caching**: AnalyzerCache with model persistence
- **Processing**: Direct batch analysis (queue system removed)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with analysis result storage
- **Access Control**: Admin-only re-analysis functionality

### **Model Training Considerations:**
- **Open Weights Advantage**: No API costs, unlimited usage, custom training
- **Training Data Sources**: Genius, LyricsGenius, MusixMatch APIs
- **Annotation Quality**: Current framework provides high-quality labels
- **Hardware Requirements**: 20B model requires significant GPU memory

## 📚 Usage Guidelines

Use these examples and guidelines to model future analyses. Be thorough, quote full Scripture (BSB), apply score logic fairly, and always offer a pastoral verdict rooted in spiritual formation.

**Important Notes:**
- Scripture references in examples are illustrative - each analysis should use contextually appropriate verses
- All biblical quotations use the Berean Standard Bible (BSB)
- Framework designed for universal music analysis with Christian evaluation criteria
- System optimized for admin-driven re-analysis with immediate batch processing
- Model caching ensures consistent performance without API dependencies

**Training Data Potential:**
This framework and its current analysis results represent a valuable training dataset for custom model development. The combination of lyrical content, theological themes, and formation guidance provides rich supervision for fine-tuning open-source language models specifically for Christian music discernment.
