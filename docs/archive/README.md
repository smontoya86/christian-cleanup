## üìù **Why These Files Were Archived**

### **Analysis Reports**
- Replaced by current documentation in `docs/`
- Historical snapshots of development decisions
- Useful for understanding project evolution

### **Evaluation Scripts**
- Replaced by fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini model
- Old local LLM evaluation approach (qwen, llama) no longer used
- Kept for reference on how evaluation evolved

### **Docker Configs**
- ML-optimized setup replaced by OpenAI API
- Test configurations no longer needed
- Production setup simplified to use fine-tuned model

### **Planning Docs**
- RunPod-based training approach abandoned for OpenAI fine-tuning
- Old strategies replaced by current production deployment
- Historical context for decision-making

## ‚ôªÔ∏è **Can These Be Deleted?**

**Yes, eventually.** These files are archived for:
1. **Historical reference** - Understanding how we got here
2. **Audit trail** - Development decision documentation
3. **Learning** - What worked, what didn't

**Recommended retention:** 6-12 months, then delete if not referenced.

## üîó **Current Active Files**

For current documentation and scripts, see:
- **Documentation:** `docs/` (current guides)
- **Evaluation:** `gold_standard/` (current eval dataset & results)
- **Production Deployment:** `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_4O_MINI.md`
- **Main README:** `README.md` (project root)

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025  
**Archived Files:** 28 total (11 analysis + 9 scripts + 4 configs + 4 planning)  
**Total Size:** ~150KB (excluding old app.zip)
